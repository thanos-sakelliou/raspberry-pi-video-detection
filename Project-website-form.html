<h4>Problem statement and motivation:</h4>
<p align=”justify”>In the last few years,There has been a lot of focus on how to get the highest performance with deep learning in object recognition. However, as the Internet of Things
becomes more prevalent, computationally efficient models are on the rise too.</p>
<p align=”justify”>
IoT devises including smartphones, embedded systems and Raspberry Pi(which we are using in this project) have limited capabilities
but it could still be worth executing these efficient DL models locally. Indeed, it could help improving
the latency as there is no round trip to a server. Also, as a lot of people becomes more aware of privacy, keeping the
data in the device is a positive point. Other elements are the connectivity and power consumption. If run locally, these
models would not rely on the network of the user. Deep Neural networks are also hungry and consume a lot of power, thus, making
models more efficient can be much more affordable to run.
</p>
For all these reasons, we are curious about how well deep learning models perform on devices with hardware limitations.
There is a bunch of practical applications, from fancy drone to autonomous driving cars, smart city applications, elder
and infant care, etc.
More specifically, we are using a couple of state-of-the-art models on the new Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with the portable Google Coral TPU, to test our hypothesis.

<h4>Research questions/hypotheses:</h4>
<ul>
<li>How classic Computer vision algorithms compare (in terms of performance and usability) with new optimized Deep Learning Techniques run on new low-cost IoT devices like Raspberry Pi 4?</li>
<li>Have these devices reached enough processing power, and state-of-the-art DL models enough optimization on object detection/recognition tasks, to produce usable results? (ex. for Smart city applications, Elder or infant care)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Main outcomes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>At the moment, we have run a computer vision algorithm based on background subtraction. Even if this approach is simple,
it is a good starting point as the computing requirement are pretty low. It will be the first model we will implement in
the raspberry pi.</li>
</ul>
